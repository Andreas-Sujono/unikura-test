# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet <address> XShoeNFT XSHOE  "https://amber-particular-cuckoo-729.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTctBgr9NsQ1qKkU8yCidke6bAzN3WqLBXqyL1KMgp8J3"
